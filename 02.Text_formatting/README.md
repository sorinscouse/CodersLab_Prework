# HTML &ndash; text formatting


Based on known HTML elements, try to create an identical structure in **index.html** file.

 ![Sample project](images/sample.jpg)

## Important
Do not overuse the line break tag **br** in the first paragraph. When writing a document in MS Word, you do not break the line after each sentence. Do the same here - let the text flow freely in the paragraph.

&#8222;Read more &gt;&#8221; should be located in a new paragraph, and the &gt; sign should be written in unicode.

Return to the slide about &#8222;Nesting lists in one another&#8221; in the presentation about HTML and CSS, and research this subject in the  [documentation][documentation]. Notice where the nested list is placed, especially where the **li** tag is closed.

Disregard the type of tag in the nested list. It does not matter if individual elements start with a circle or square symbol. It is important to make it an unordered list (**ul**).
