# HTML &ndash; document structure


1. Fill the **index.html** file:

    * add a title to the page,

    * link the stylesheet (**style.css** file is in the **css** catalog).

2. In **style.css** file, set a background color for the element called ```body```. This will enable you to verify if the stylesheet was successfully added to the page.

3. Add a paragraph to the body and fill it with the words of &#8222;Lorem ipsum&#8221;.

### Important
Code culture is very important. Remember to make appropriate indentations in your code, no matter if it's HTML or CSS. Before you start doing the prework, read the article on [the principles of writing legible code](https://codepen.io/...............).
