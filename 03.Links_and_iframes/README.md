# HTML &ndash; lists, links & Iframes

1. Add the links below to the **index.html** file, arranged just as you see them below. Add **target="_blank"** only to the first group. Compare effects with the second group and describe them in a comment.

 * Beautiful Website in 2014 and 2015
    * [www.awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/responsive-design)
    * [www.behance.net](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19230847/website-design-best-of-2014)
 * Useful tools for web developers
    * [www.creativebloq.com](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/must-have-tools-developers-31411174)
    * [tutorialzine.com](https://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/50-awesome-tools-and-resources-for-web-developers)


2. Add an **iframe** to the **index.html** file. Set your favorite website with IT news as the **src** attribute.


### Important
Just like in the previous exercise, remember to properly nest elements within the list. Disregard the type of tag in the nested list. It does not matter if individual elements start with a circle or square symbol. It is important to make it an unordered list (**ul**).
