# CSS &ndash; colors and units in CSS

**Attention! Write styles in the **style.css** file, not inline.**
**Try not to use HTML tags as selectors in the CSS file.**

1. Create two  **span** elements and give them different font colors using keywords.

2. Create a **p** paragraph with the following text: "CSS is wonderful". Set a different color for each word using predefined names (e.g. red, green, darkkhaki). Each word can be in a separate span element.

3. Create a **div** element with the ``colorUnits`` class and 3 paragraphs within it (**p** elements). Enter some text in the paragraphs, give each one a background color written in another way (hexadecimal, RGBa and HSL).

4. Create a **div** element with the ```container``` class. Create 2 **p** paragraphs within it, filled with any text you want. In CSS, set any background color for the entire container and set width to 200px.

5. For each **p** paragraph from the previous exercise set different background color. Change their width in the following way:
	* the first paragraph in percentages, e.g.: **width: 50%;**. Give this paragraph the ```first``` class;
	* the second paragraph in em units, e.g.: **width: 10em;**. Give this paragraph the ```second``` class.
